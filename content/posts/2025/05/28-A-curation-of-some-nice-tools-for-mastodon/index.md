As some of you know I run a Mastodon instance based on glitch-soc. While using Mastodon I discovered a few cool tools that make Mastodon more interesting to use. This post here is a curated list. I'll try to update it from time to time if I discover new stuff.

## Browser
There are some nice Browser add-ons or web tools. Most of them are available on Chromium based browsers, too. However since I am using Firefox based browsers, I will link the Firefox add-on here.  
- **[Steetpass for Mastodon](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/streetpass-for-mastodon)**: If you visit a website (for example my blog), that has a Mastodon account linked with it, it will save this account. You can later see the accounts you found by browsing the web and then follow them via this extension.
- **[Phanpy](https://phanpy.social)**: This is a web client for browsers that has some nice features and looks awesome. (Tip: You can use Streetpass with Phanpy, so that a user account opens directly in Phanpy.)
- **[Mastometrics](https://mastometrics.com)**: Gives you some nice statistics about your account and posts.
- **[Fedi.Tips](https://fedi.tips)**: A website that gives you tips and an introductions to Mastodon and the rest of the Fediverse of which Mastodon is part of.

## iOS
- **[Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/)**: A very good iOS app for Mastodon.
- **[Ice Cubes](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884?platform=iphone)**: Another really good iOS app for Mastodon.
- **[The official app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mastodon/id1571998974?platform=iphone)**: Mastodon also has a very good iOS app that comes from the developers of the platform itself. However it lacks the federated timeline, which is useful for discovering content on smaller instances.

## Android
- **[Tusky](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keylesspalace.tusky)**: My favorite Android app for Mastodon.
- **[Moshidon](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.joinmastodon.android.moshinda)**: A fork of the official Mastodon app on Android, that adds some extra features like the federated timeline, which is very useful on smaller instances with only a few users.
