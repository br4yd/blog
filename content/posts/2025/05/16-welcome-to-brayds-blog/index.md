Welcome to my blog. I already had a blog previously but decided to start from scratch on a new domain.  
The reason for this was, that my old blog used the same domain as the services that I host use. It was reachable via https://braydmedia.de. I thought this is kinda confusing for people that for example use my Mastodon instance at https://glitch.braydmedia.de, when they visit the root domain.  
In the future https://braydmedia.de will contain meta information regarding the services I run as a hobby. This blog is my personal blog and is therefore separate.  

## So what will you find here?
I will mostly write about the topics that interest me. This is for example IT-Stuff, Linux, veganism, but also posts about books, traveling and more.

## How to subscribe to this blog?
Well, my old blog used a software called Ghost. It was more advanced, but also slower to render. It had a feature that included mailing lists. I liked it, but it was rather expensive to pay for the mails that get sent to the subscribers. I decided to not have a newsletter with my new blog now.  
This blog will be simpler but therefore faster and cleaner. Imagine it like a blog from the early 2000s but more modern looking. If you want to get informed about new posts you can subscribe to the [RSS-Feed](https://brayd.blog/posts/index.xml) with your favorite RSS-Reader (i.e. [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/)) or you can follow me on [Mastodon](https://glitch.braydmedia.de/@brayd) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:rwknrk4qp3xgy6kndprmrn4r). I will inform you there when I publish a new post.
